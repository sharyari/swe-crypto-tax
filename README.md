Calculate taxable events given the transaction history

At the moment, this requires that the starting point is a state where there are no crypto in the wallet. This could be the beginning of the wallet.
If not, one would have to start from a point in time where the average cost of all cryptos are known.
Swedish rules for stocks allow for something called "schablonmodellen" - if the prior cost is unknown, one may pay 20% of the total sell-price in taxes. I don't know if this is a valid method for crypto coins as well
